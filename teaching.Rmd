There are no current teaching activities planned at the moment.

## Courses & Tutorials

I am in the process of creating an R online course as well as one for deep-learning. More on that, soon!<br>
In the meantime you can find materials related to tutorials I have presented on my [Github](https://github.com/h21k).

I also have an R book in manuscript form that I plan to publish sometime this year.
