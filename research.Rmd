## Research Interests

<p align="justify">Artificial intelligence (deep learning/machine learning), baysian analytics and human-computer interaction focused on medical device as well as aviation systems safety including big data analysis & visualisation: human error, empirical studies, perceptual interference, disfluencey, cognitive theory, augmented reality, probabilistic timing analysis, software modeling, autonomous systems, robotics, unmanned-areal vehicle control systems, flight-deck system safety, cyber-security, forensics</p>

## Current focus at King's College London

<p align="justify">I am currently working on the [Robotreviewer](http://www.robotreviewer.net/) (MRC/NIH Fellowship) project: working on novel methods for <b>automatic bias assessment</b> in systematic reviews based on <b>natural language processing</b> and state-of-the-art <b>deep-learning algorithms</b>; supervising user-experience studies; evaluating neural text extraction and classification models</p>

## Research Grant
<p align="justify">My research is supported by [NVIDIA Corporation](http://www.nvidia.com/) via the [NVIDIA academic GPU grant program](https://developer.nvidia.com/academic_gpu_seeding).</p>
