## Title
<p>Treatments of Primary Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Skin</p>

### Subtitle
<p>A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis</p>

## Abstract

Background: Most interventions for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) have not been compared in head-to-head randomized trials.
Purpose: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of treatments of primary BCC in adults.
Data Sources: English-language searches of MEDLINE, Coch- rane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Embase from inception to May 2018; reference lists of guidelines and systematic reviews; and a search of ClinicalTrials.gov in August 2016.
Study Selection: Comparative studies of treatments currently used in adults with primary BCC.
Data Extraction: One investigator extracted data on recur- rence, histologic clearance, clinical clearance, cosmetic out- comes, quality of life, and mortality, and a second reviewer veri- fied extractions. Several investigators evaluated risk of bias for each study.

Data Synthesis: Forty randomized trials and 5 nonrandomized studies compared 18 interventions in 9 categories. Relative inter- vention effects and mean outcome frequencies were estimated using frequentist network meta-analyses. Estimated recurrence rates were similar for excision (3.8% [95% CI, 1.5% to 9.5%]), Mohs surgery (3.8% [CI, 0.7% to 18.2%]), curettage and dia- thermy (6.9% [CI, 0.9% to 36.6%]), and external-beam radiation (3.5% [CI, 0.7% to 16.8%]). Recurrence rates were higher for cryotherapy (22.3% [CI, 10.2% to 42.0%]), curettage and cryo- therapy (19.9% [CI, 4.6% to 56.1%]), 5-fluorouracil (18.8% [CI, 10.1% to 32.5%]), imiquimod (14.1% [CI, 5.4% to 32.4%]), and photodynamic therapy using methyl-aminolevulinic acid (18.8% [CI, 10.1% to 32.5%]) or aminolevulinic acid (16.6% [CI, 7.5% to 32.8%]). 

Automatic Evicence Updates

Limitation: Data are sparse, and effect estimates are imprecise and informed by indirect comparisons.
Conclusion: Surgical treatments and external-beam radiation have low recurrence rates for the treatment of low-risk BCC, but substantial uncertainty exists about their comparative effective- ness versus other treatments. Gaps remain regarding high-risk BCC subtypes and important outcomes, including costs.

## Results

The literature searches returned 16 154 citations, of which 519 were retrieved and screened in full text. Forty RCTs and 5 NRCSs were eligible (Supplement Figure and Supplement Tables 1 and 2, available at Annals.org). The randomized evidence base is sparse (Part B of the Supplement). Across all outcomes, the RCTs examined 18 interventions and provided data on 34 head-to-head comparisons, out of 153 possible comparisons. Of the 34 comparisons, 33 were in- formed by at most 3 trials.

## Discussion

On the basis of sparse evidence and with substan- tial imprecision, surgery and external-beam radiation have lower recurrence rates than other modalities for the treatment of BCC. In order for clinicians, patients, and payers to make informed decisions about treating BCC, new RCT or high-quality NRCS evidence is needed.
