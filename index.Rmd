I am a Computer Scientist at [King's College London](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/frank.soboczenski.html) & a [NASA Globe STEM scientist](https://www.globe.gov/web/frank.soboczenski/home). My current research focuses on Deep-Learning and Natural-Language Processing in Healthcare in form of the [RobotReviewer](http://www.robotreviewer.net/) project. 

I have previously worked in areas such as [Human-Computer Interaction](http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~feynman/), [Cyber-Security](https://www.york.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-taught/courses/msc-cyber-security/) and [Real-Time Systems](http://www.proxima-project.eu/) in cooperation with the [German Police Force](http://www.polizei.bayern.de/), [GCHQ](https://www.gchq.gov.uk/), [Rapita Systems](https://www.rapitasystems.com/), [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en/), [Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es/) & [Airbus](http://www.airbus.com/). I worked also as a lead organizer of [NASA Space Apps challenges]() and worked on AI projects with the National Space Society as well as law enforcement entities

During my work I have developed numerous applications for science and industry and I particularly enjoy bringing state-of-the-art technologies together to solve challenging problems. 

I graduated from the [University of Minnesota](http://www.sph.umn.edu/academics/divisions/biostatistics/) with a MS in biostatistics in 2010. In 2012 I began working toward my DrPH in biostatistics as a part-time student at [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics), where I am investigating statistical methods for the study of etiologic heterogeneity in epidemiologic studies under the advisement of [Dr. Shuang Wang](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/sw2206) at Columbia University and [Dr. Colin Begg](https://www.mskcc.org/profile/colin-begg) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. I expect to graduate by the end of 2018.
