<p align="justify">I graduated from the [Deggendorf Institute of Technology](https://www.th-deg.de/en) in cooperation with the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.dfki.de/web) and was awarded with a PhD for my work on reducing transcription errors (numerical and textual) of medical devices under the advisement of [Dr. Paul Cairns](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~pcairns/) and [Prof. Richard Paige](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/paige) at the [University of York](https://cs.york.ac.uk).</p>

<p align="justify">I am a known R Ninja, currently organising the [R User Group](https://www.kcl.ac.uk) at King's College and joined the [NASA Frontier Development Lab](https://frontierdevelopmentlab.org/) (FDL) as AI researcher in 2018. Most recently, I supported the Astronaut Health & Lunar Resource Mapping teams as AI/ML mentor during the 2019 edition of FDL.</p>
